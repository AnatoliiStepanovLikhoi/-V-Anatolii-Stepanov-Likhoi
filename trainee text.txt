Trainee front-end developer with an ability to
            collaborate effectively with other developers while spending extra
            time to be mentored. Enjoy working closely with team members to
            ensure workloads are effectively redirected to bottlenecks and
            personally picking up the slack when necessary. With a passion for
            both personal growth and for software development, I`ve attended a
            500+ hours coding during GoIT courses to learn new languages,
            frameworks and sharpening existing skill set. Ready to apply my
            passion and knowledge for coding to a creative engineering team to
            develop quality solutions.
